objective: Research the current projects structure and content in this Nuxt 4 website
focus_area: Projects content structure
created_at: 2026-02-22
created_by: gem-researcher
status: completed

tldr: |
  - Projects stored in `content/projects.yml` with Zod schema validation in `content.config.ts`
  - 9 projects total across 5 categories (Open Source, Development Tools, Web Application, SaaS, Portfolio)
  - Featured projects filtered by `featured: true` flag and displayed via `FeaturedProjects.vue` component
  - Projects support rich metadata: businessImpact, testimonials, client info, stats, features, challenges, outcomes
  - No explicit Paragon-related projects found in current data
  - Projects queried via `useProjectsData()` composable using Nuxt Content's `queryCollection()`
  - Category filtering implemented in `/projects` page with computed `filteredProjects`
  - Projects ordered by file sequence (id field), no explicit sorting in composables

open_questions:
  - question: How are projects ordered when displayed? No explicit sorting found in composables.
    context: useProjectsData() and useFeaturedProjects() do not apply .order() or .sort(), projects appear in file sequence order
  - question: What is the purpose of the "type" field (Open Source, Client Project, SaaS Product, etc.)?
    context: type field exists in schema and data (e.g., "Open Source", "Client Project") but only used as a small badge in projects page
  - question: How are category counts maintained in the categories array?
    context: categories array has count field that should match actual project counts, but no validation or automation found
  - question: Are there plans to add Paragon-related projects?
    context: Paragon Square Inc. mentioned in nuxt.config.ts as employer, but no Paragon projects exist in current projects.yml

gaps:
  - area: Project sorting/ordering mechanism
    description: No explicit sorting logic found in composables or components
    impact: Cannot determine if projects are intentionally ordered or appear in file sequence
  - area: Case study integration
    description: case_study link field exists in schema but no projects have case_study links populated
    impact: CaseStudyPreview component may not display any content
  - area: Category count validation
    description: No mechanism to ensure categories.count matches actual project counts
    impact: Category counts may become inconsistent if projects are added/removed without updating counts
  - area: Paragon projects
    description: Paragon Square Inc. listed as employer but no Paragon-related projects in portfolio
    impact: Missing opportunity to showcase current work experience
