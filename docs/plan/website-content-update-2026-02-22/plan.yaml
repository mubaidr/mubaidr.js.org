tldr: |
  Add two high-complexity Paragon projects (ParagonRentals.ai and ParagonSquare.ai) to the portfolio,
  reorder projects to prioritize high-impact work, create a technical blog post on a relevant topic,
  and ensure all content follows SEO best practices with proper OG images and schema.org markup.

open_questions:
  - question: What technical topic should the new blog post cover?
    context: Options include "Nuxt 4 SSR Performance Optimization", "Building Multi-Marketplace Platforms with Nuxt", "Real-Time Communication in Modern Web Apps", or let planner decide
  - question: Should projects be prioritized by complexity, business impact, recency, or a combination?
    context: Options include "Complexity & Impact combined", "Most recent first", "Business impact only", or let planner decide

pre_mortem:
  overall_risk_level: medium
  critical_failure_modes:
    - scenario: Zod schema validation fails for new project entries
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: Validate project structure against content.config.ts schema before committing; run npm run type-check after changes
    - scenario: OG image dimensions incorrect or missing
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: Use standardized 1200x630 dimensions; verify image file exists in /public/img/blog/ before referencing
    - scenario: Blog post frontmatter missing required fields
      likelihood: low
      impact: high
      mitigation: Follow existing blog post pattern from 1-my-first-blog-post.md; include all required fields (title, description, date, author)
    - scenario: SEO meta tags not rendering correctly
      likelihood: low
      impact: medium
      mitigation: Test in dev mode with npm run dev; verify meta tags in browser DevTools and social media preview tools
    - scenario: Category counts become inconsistent after adding projects
      likelihood: medium
      impact: low
      mitigation: Update categories array count field manually to match actual project counts
  assumptions:
    - User has access to create/edit files in content/ directory
    - Images for OG images can be created or sourced appropriately
    - Blog post topic will be relevant to current technical work (Paragon projects)
    - Existing SEO patterns in blog/[...slug].vue will work for new blog post
    - Nuxt dev server will be available for testing changes
