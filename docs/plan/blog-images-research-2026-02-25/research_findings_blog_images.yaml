  - 33 blog posts total (numbered 1-33), with 26 SVG banner images created in public/img/blog/
  - All blog posts use consistent socialImage frontmatter pattern with src, mime, alt, width, height fields
  - Banner SVGs follow standard 1200x630 Open Graph dimensions with gradient backgrounds and consistent styling
  - 7 blog posts missing corresponding SVG directories: posts 28-33 (most recent posts from Feb 2026)
  - SVG syntax is valid across all examined files with proper gradients, filters, and text elements
  - Pattern: Each blog post has dedicated directory under public/img/blog/{post-slug}/ containing banner.svg

  methodology: "Hybrid retrieval using file_search for SVG discovery, read_file for frontmatter analysis across 15+ blog posts, list_dir for directory structure verification, and grep_search for socialImage pattern matching"

open_questions:
  - question: "Why do posts 28-33 lack corresponding SVG directories?"
    context: "These are the most recent posts (Feb 2026) and appear to be missing banner.svg files"
  - question: "What is the process for creating new blog post SVGs?"
    context: "No documentation found; may be manual process or external tool"
  - question: "Are there fallback images for posts without socialImage?"
    context: "Need to verify if NuxtSeo has default OG image configuration"
  - question: "Is there an automated process to generate SVGs from templates?"
    context: "All SVGs follow similar pattern; could be generated programmatically"

gaps:
  - area: "Missing SVGs for posts 28-33"
    description: "Blog posts 28-33 (edge-computing-serverless-guide-2026 through full-stack-development-2026-roadmap) have socialImage frontmatter but no corresponding directories in public/img/blog/"
    impact: "HIGH - Social media shares will show broken images or defaults, reducing engagement and professional appearance"
  - area: "No automated SVG generation"
    description: "SVG creation appears manual despite consistent template structure"
    impact: "MEDIUM - Time-consuming to create new blog post banners; risk of inconsistency"
  - area: "Missing fallback/default OG image"
    description: "No evidence of default social image configuration in nuxt.config.ts"
    impact: "MEDIUM - Posts without images (or during image load failures) have no fallback"
  - area: "No image optimization pipeline"
    description: "SVGs are served as-is; no mention of compression or optimization"
    impact: "LOW - SVGs are already optimized but could benefit from compression"
  - area: "Incomplete image documentation"
    description: "No guidelines for creating new blog post images (dimensions, style, colors)"
    impact: "MEDIUM - New contributors won't know how to create consistent banners"
